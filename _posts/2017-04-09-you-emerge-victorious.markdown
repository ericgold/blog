title: "You Emerge Victorious"

As you exit the maze, the crowd of villagers cheer appreciatively.

They probably didn't expect you to come back at all. No one ever has. So now they face a bit of a dilemma. Of course, you don't know that. But in his private thoughts, the sheriff considers his options. 

Should he tell you that he asked you to enter the maze under false pretenses? That you were intended to be a sacrifice to whatever strange council directed the maze's original construction? And if so, how would he purport to have come to know of this requirement. Certainly, he couldn't reveal the manual he kept in his personal gun locker, the one his predecessor had given him on his first day on the job. 

Again, you don't know a thing of these private thoughts of the sheriff. Instead, you're focused on the clapping hands, the smiling children, the improvised waving flag of a pair of work pants tied to a wooden pole. 

You approach the crowd, and it parts for you as the guide, the village's contact with the outside world, the woman who met you in the forest and led you here three days ago, steps forward to meet you.
