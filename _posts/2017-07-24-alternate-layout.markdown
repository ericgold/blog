## A different kind of post

Creating a different kind of post layout. If this copy extends further, I will be able to get a better idea of what the post will look like with content.

Eventually, I might set up a set of a half-dozen or so different post layouts, depending on what type of content I'm including in the project.

The first thing that comes to mind is that I think I want to reduce the line length a bit. So I guess I'll add some right and left padding to the container right now and see how that looks. Then I can continue to make small changes until I've come up with something a bit different from the standard post layout. 

One other change I might make is repositioning the title.
